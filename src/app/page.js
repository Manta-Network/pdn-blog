            We are <strong>Zug</strong> (can be also called Zug ZK), an research
            and community driven project. Our vision is to scale and compose
            zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) on blockchains, starting from Ethereum.
            We think zero-knowledge proofs + blockchains brings better and more
            trustless coordination to human society. And one of the remaining
            big problems is how to make ZKP scalable and composable on
            blockchains. We are building the first proof aggregation service on
            Ethereum, which uses our{' '}
            <strong> Universal ZK-ZK Proof Aggregation</strong> construction to
            aggregate all kinds of ZKPs, including but not limited to as privacy
            preserving identities, storage proofs, ZKML, zkEVM proofs. This
            proof aggregation service could:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Multiply the bandwith and lower the cost (by orders of magnitude) of ZKP verfication on Ethereum (and its L2s)
              </li>
