            We are <strong>Zug</strong> (can be also called Zug ZK), an research 
            and community driven project. Our vision is to scale and compose zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) on blockchains,
            starting from Ethereum. We think zero-knowledge proof + blockchain brings trustless coordination 
            to human society. And one of some the key infrastructure is to scale ZKP verfication and make ZKP composable.
